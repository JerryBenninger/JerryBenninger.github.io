## Guidelines

### Thumbnails
Thumbnail images should be 500 x 250 pixels.
They should be uploaded into the Images folder, in a folder named with the project's slug (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces).
The name and file type of the images does not matter.
The album's cover image will be the first image in the folder in alphabetical order.
